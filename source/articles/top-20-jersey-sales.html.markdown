					<a href="http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/story/2676490/clint-dempsey-first-major-league-soccer-jersey-sales-top-20">Back-to-back Jersey Sales</a> Champion Clint Dempsey
					has been dethroned by New York City FC’s Andrea Pirlo. 
					Dempsey jersey sales skyrocketed after the 2014 World 
					Cup but Pirlo’s playmaking ability has proven too tough 
					for fans to ignore. Couple that with NYCFC holding 1st place 
					in the Eastern Conference while Seattle blundered its way to 
					the 4th worst record overall, one can easily understand the 
					changing of the guard.<br><br>
					Some of Andrea Pirlo's best work can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LwNXb3q5I">here</a>.

					The MLS’s leading goal scorer, David Villa (12 goals), sits 
					in third with Seattle youngster Jordan Morris taking forth. 
					It’s worth watching whether Morris’s sales continue as the 
					abysmal Sounders season carries on. The Stanford grad is a 
					glimmer of hope for the Emerald City. The Top 5 is closed 
					out by LA Galaxy’s Steven Gerrard. The former Liverpool 
					midfielder is having a productive inaugural MLS season and 
					his popularity should only continue to grow.

				<p align="left">A smattering of former overseas player 
					(Kaká, Didier Drogba, Sebastian Giovinco, and Frank Lampard) 
					take up spots 6-9. Sporting KC’s Dom Dwyer comes in at no. 10. 
					After breaking his right foot three times during his college career, 
					Dwyer was told by doctors that his professional aspirations would never 
					be realized. Dwyer persevered and now holds the Sporting KC single season 
					goal scoring record (22 goals).</p>

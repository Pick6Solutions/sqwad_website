We’re halfway through the 2016 MLS season and we know what’s on your mind: Jersey sales.

[Back-to-back Jersey Sales](http://www.espnfc.us/major-league-soccer/story/2676490/clint-dempsey-first-major-league-soccer-jersey-sales-top-20) Champion Clint Dempsey has been dethroned by New York City FC’s Andrea Pirlo. Dempsey jersey sales skyrocketed after the 2014 World Cup but Pirlo’s playmaking ability has proven too tough for fans to ignore. Couple that with NYCFC holding 1st place in the Eastern Conference while Seattle blundered its way to the 4th worst record overall, one can easily understand the changing of the guard.  

Some of Andrea Pirlo's best work can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4LwNXb3q5I).

The MLS’s leading goal scorer, David Villa (12 goals), sits in third with Seattle youngster Jordan Morris taking forth. It’s worth watching whether Morris’s sales continue as the abysmal Sounders season carries on. The Stanford grad is a glimmer of hope for the Emerald City. The Top 5 is closed out by LA Galaxy’s Steven Gerrard. The former Liverpool midfielder is having a productive inaugural MLS season and his popularity should only continue to grow.

A smattering of former overseas player (Kaká, Didier Drogba, Sebastian Giovinco, and Frank Lampard) take up spots 6-9\. Sporting KC’s Dom Dwyer comes in at no. 10\. After breaking his right foot three times during his college career, Dwyer was told by doctors that his professional aspirations would never be realized. Dwyer persevered and now holds the Sporting KC single season goal scoring record (22 goals).

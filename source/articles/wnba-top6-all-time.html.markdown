_Background: SQWAD will be running this Top6 series where fans will do the near impossible: give their picks for the top 6 WNBA players of all-time in order._

_For a chance to be featured send your picks and a short why for each to: __nlawson@sqwadapp.co_

I guess I will start off what is the hardest task in all of sports, picking a top 6 all-time player list. Let the debating begin!

1) Tina Thompson: Tina was the first superstar in the league. 4x Champ, 9X All-Star, 1st in scoring all-time. Not much else to say here, she is the best in my book.

2) Diana Taurasi: Fiery and dominant. Dee is the ultimate competitor in the game. 3X Champ, 2X finals MVP, 9X All-Star, and League MVP. I wouldn’t want anybody else shooting the last shot in the game for me. By the time she is done may be the best ever, #2 for now on my list. (Below might be the most epic WNBA highlight video ever)

3) Tamika Catchings: Did you know Catchings was drafted 3rd overall? (LJ #1 overall that year) 10x all-star, WNBA Champ and League MVP, second to 7K points, she will be missed after this season. Holds the top spot in steals, where she has 30% more than any player in the league. Pure grit player.

4) Maya Moore: Since Maya has come into the league she has done what was expected of her, dominate the league. In 5 years she has 3 WNBA championships, 4 All-Star selections, and 1 MVP. She and Dee will be battling it out for best by the time they are done playing in my opinion.

5) Lauren Jackson: LJ was the ultimate utility, talked to someone the other day about how Delle Donne may be her reincarnation. 2X champ, 3X MVP, 7X all-star, the big Aussie was a baller in Australia and the WNBA. If she closes 2 more titles she is the best ever.

6) Lisa Leslie: 2X champ, 3X MVP, rebound machine and nightmare on D. Lisa was the face of the league and a huge presence on the court. Rule #1….Don’t drive on her through the lane.

Next 3: Sue Bird, Becky Hammon, Cynthia Cooper.

Hardest to leave out: Candace Parker, Seimone Augustus

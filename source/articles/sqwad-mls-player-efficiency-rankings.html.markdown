With SQWAD, fans have the ability to buy players for the season, 5 games, or 3 games in our free agency feature. Just like in real sports free agency, you will want to buy players that can help you win at the lowest price and highest value.

Our rankings are based on the 2016 MLS stats as of May 5th and take into account goals, assists, shots on goal(SOG), game winning goals(GWG), home goals(HMG), and road goals(RDG).

The SQWAD Efficiency Score is what we use to rank our players today, and the stat is based on cold hard statistics from game-to-game. If a player starts to slump mid-season, their SQWAD score and price will drop. If they go on a hot streak the rank and price go up.

We believe in letting the stats speak for themselves. There is no bias here, only hard numbers, and you decide who you want in your SQWAD.

Now lets get down to it….

2016 SQWAD MLS Top 30 Most Efficient Players

Our top ranked player might surprise some of you but it is David Accam. Accam plays for the Chicago Fire and currently is sidelined. Coach Veljko Paunovic wants him to improve his fitness before returning play. Accam has been out with a sprained knee since March. Accam in his two appearances has been absolute fire. Playing in only 180 minutes he has 6 shots on goal, 1 assist, and 2 goals. Its likely this type of production will slow a tad but numbers don’t lie. You will not find a more efficient player than Accam right now.

Our second ranked player, Alvaro Saborio, is another one of those players that has had phenomenal production in a short amount of time. Scoring 3 goals and an assist in only 221 minutes of play is staggering and perhaps could be a sign that he is returning to his 2010–2013 production levels.

Third we have Sebastian Giovinco, who has not needed a limited amount of minutes to boost his SQWAD score. He has played 719 minutes with 6 goals and 3 assists; it would be difficult to find a Toronto goal he hasn’t played a major part in.

Number 4 is Fabian Espindola who has been an extremely productive forward since 2007. Look for his productive ways to continue as he already has 3 goals and 13 shots on goals while playing only 468 minutes. If he can convert a few more of those shots he will rise up the ranks.

At number 5 Ricardo Kaka has scored 2 goals and 2 assists in only 260 minutes. He is one of the elite MLS players and certainly will stay among the highest ranked players going forward.

Ranks 6–10 don’t show a ton of variance and at this point in the season it’s hard to tell who is going to end up where. However, watch out for David Villa. Although putting up zero assists so far he is a goal-scoring machine with 6 already on the season. His most impressive stat is his 22 SOG which is almost 2x the amount of anyone else in our top 30.

11–30 are where we start really seeing some underrated talent. Obviously Robbie Keane is an absolute steal at #28, having a combined 71 goals from 2012–2015.

Didier Drogba had a phenomenal overseas career and is continuing his success in the MLS adding 11 goals in 11 games with the Montreal Impact last year. He cooled off a little bit during the playoffs but I still believe he has tremendous upside.

Fanendo Adi and Chris Wondolowski have 7 goals in 679 and 810 minutes of play, respectively. They both are phenomenal talents that should creep into the top 10.

Clearly players 11–30 give you the best opportunity to start finding efficient players at great value.
